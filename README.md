# HEALTH_INSURANCE_CROSS_SELL_PREDICTION
 Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers. Now they need the help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from the past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.

Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimize its business model and revenue.
